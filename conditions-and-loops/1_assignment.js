//Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

console.log(
  "Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of execution of a program based on certain conditions. They allow you to write code that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false."
);

//Syntax:

// if (condition)
//{
//   // code to execute if the condition is true
// }
//else {
//   // code to execute if the condition is false
// }
// Example:

let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}

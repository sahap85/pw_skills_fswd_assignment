Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are useful for tasks that need to be done repeatedly, 
such as iterating over a collection of data or performing calculations.

Types of loops:

For loop: Used to iterate a specific number of times.
While loop: Used to iterate until a condition becomes false.
Do...while loop: Similar to a while loop, but it always executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is false initially.
Syntax:

// For loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // code to execute
}

// While loop
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  // code to execute
  i++;
}

// Do...while loop
let i = 0;
do {
  // code to execute
  i++;
} while (i < 5);


Example:

// Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

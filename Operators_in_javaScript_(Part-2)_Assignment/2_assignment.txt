Q2. Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

The comma operator in JavaScript is used to evaluate multiple expressions and return the value of the last expression. 
It can be used to combine multiple expressions into a single statement.

syntax:-
expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN

The expressions are evaluated from left to right.
Each expression is evaluated, but only the value of the last expression is returned.

example:-

// Program to demonstrate the usage of the comma operator
var x = (5, 10); // x is assigned the value of the last expression, which is 10
console.log(x); // Output: 10
